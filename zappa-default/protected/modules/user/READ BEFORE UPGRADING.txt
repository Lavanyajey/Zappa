The customizations of this module are:
1. widgets folder with login widget (did not exist originally).
2. UserModule::module() method added and all Yii::app()->controller->module replace with UserModule::module().
3. YumUserController.php changed the access rules and commented out unnecessary actions and updated a lot of methods by renaming the original methods to "actionSomethingORIGINAl".
4. Customized the profile-edit view.
5. protected/modules/user/components/YumWebUser.php
-       return isset($user->users);
+		return !empty($user->users);
6. Change password and profile edit views were updated with "Back to settings" link. Also respective actions have an overriden layout.
7. $this->_urls['return']=$this->_urls['returnLogout']=Yii::app()->homeUrl; in the USerModule::init().
8. customized registration form.
9. immediately login after succesful registration. for that I had to comment some code out in the registration action.
